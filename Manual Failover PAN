Manual Failover PAN
########################

What to do next
After the promotion of Secondary PAN to the Primary PAN, do the following: 
  - Manually sync the old Primary PAN to bring it back into the deployment. 
  - Manually sync any other secondary node that is out-of sync, to bring it back into the deployment. 
Manually Promote Secondary PAN To Primary
If the Primary PAN fails and you have not configured PAN auto-failover, you must manually promote the Secondary PAN to become the new Primary PAN. 

Before you begin
Ensure that you have a second Cisco ISE node configured with the Administration persona to promote as your Primary PAN. 

Procedure
Step 1	Log in to the user interface of the Secondary PAN. 
Step 2	Choose Administration > System > Deployment. 
Step 3	In the Edit Node page, click Promote to Primary. 
You can only promote a Secondary PAN to become the Primary PAN. Cisco ISE nodes that assume only the Policy Service or Monitoring persona, or both, cannot be promoted to become the Primary PAN. 
Step 4	Click Save.
